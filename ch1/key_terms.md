## abstract data type
The logical description of how we view the data and the operations that are allowed without regard to how they will be implementd. It is often defined by its behavior from the point of vew of a user, of the data, specifically in terms of possible values, possible operations on data of this type, and the behavior of these operations.
## class
A description of what the data looks like (the state) and what the data can do (the behavior). In python a class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.
## data structure
Structures that can hold some data often used to store a collection of related data. There are four built-in data structures in python-list, tuple, dictionary, set.
## dictionary
Dictionaries are collections of associated pairs of items where each pair consists of a key and a value. Dictionaries are unordered.
## format operator
The % operator is a string operator called the format operator. The left side of the expression holds the template or format string, and the right side holds a collection of values that will be substituted into the format string.
## implementation independent
This means to hide implementation details and only present what is to be accomplished by crafting method signatures around testable behaviors. It means using APIs to create clear ocntracts for services while hiding as much as possible about how those services do their work.
## inheritance hierarchy
If more than one class is inherited from the base class, it's known as hierarchical inheritance. In hierarchical inheritance, all features that are common in child classes are included in the base class.
## list
A list is a data structure in Python that is a mutable, or changable, ordered sequence of elements. Each element or value that is inside of a list is called an item.
## mutability
A mutable object in python can  be changed after it is created.
## programming
The process of creating a set of instructions that tell a computer how to perform a task usually with the use of a computer programming language.
## shallow equality
Shallow equality compares only the references and not the contents of objects. When comparing two objects `==` will default do a shallow equality check, however the same `==` will do a deep equality check when comparing two different lists.

## subclass
The class that inherits from a superclass is called a subclass.
## abstraction
Hiding all but the relevant data about an object in order to reduce complexity and increase efficiency.
## computable
We say that a problem is computable if an algorithm exists for solving it. 
## data type
a particular kind of data item, as defined by the values it can take, the programming language used, or the operations that can be performed on it.
## encapsulation
The process of wrapping up variables and methods into a single entity. In programming, a class is an example that wraps all the variables and methods defined inside it. 
## formatted strings
A formatted string is an ASCII string that contains text and format parameters. Example: 
>>> printf("my name is : %s\n", "Akash");     
My name is : Akash.
## information hiding
The principle of segregation of the design decisions in a computer program that are most likely to change, thus protecting other parts of the program from extensive modification if the design decision is changed.
## interface
An interface tells us what an object can do to play its role in a system. In object oriented programming, an interface is a set of publicly accessible methods on an object which can be used by other parts of the program to interact with that object.
## list comprehension
List comprehension is an elegant way to define and create lists based on existing lists. It can be more compact and faster than normal functions and loops for creating list. 
## object 
An object, in object-oriented programming, is an abstracct data type created by a developer. It can include multiple properties and methods and may even contain other objects. In most programming languages, objects are defined as classes. Objects provide a structured approach to programming.
## prompt
">>>" is called a prompt. It's something the computer displays to tell you it's ready for your instructions.
## simulation
imitation of a situation or process
## superclass
Also known as the parent class of a child class (subclass)
## algorithm
A process or set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations, especially by a computer.
## data abstraction
The reduction of a particular body of data to a simplified representation of the whole. Abstraction, in general, is the process of taking away or removing characteristics from something in order to reduce it to a set of essential characteristics. 
## deep equality
Deep equality means you compare contents of your objects
## exception
When an error occurs, or exceptions as we call it, Python will normally stop and generate an error message.
## HAS-A relationship 
HAS-A relationship uses the concept of composition to enable you to reuse code by adding objects to other objects, as opposed to inheriting the interface and implementation of other classes. (example: both horse and dog class can leverage the functionality of the Tail through composition without deriving one class from the other)
## inheritance
Classes that inherit from another are called derived classes, subclasses, or subtypes. Classes from which other classes are derived are called base classes or super classes. A derived class is said to derive, inherit, or extend a base class.
## IS-A relationship
When you have a base class and you derive from it to create a new class, that inheritance relationship states that the new class IS-A base class. (example: a Horse is an Anmial)

## method
A method is a function that belongs to an object. In python the term method is not unique to class instances: other objects can have methods as well. For example list objects have methods (ie append, insert, remove, sort)
## procedural abstraction
A particular mechanism for separating use from implementation. It is tied to the idea that each particular method permorms a well-specified funciton. In some cases, a method may calculate the answer to a particular question.
## self
Self represents the instance of the class. By using the "self" keyword we can access the attributes and methods of the class in python. It binds the attributes with the given arguments. 
## string
An array of bytes representing unicode characters
## truth table
A truth table has one column for each input variable and one final column showing all of the possible results of the logical operation that table represents.
