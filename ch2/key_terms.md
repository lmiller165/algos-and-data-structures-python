## average case
In most cases algorithms perform somewhere in between best case and worst case, we call this the average case.

## checking off
Checking an item in a data structure one by one

## log linear
O(n log n)

## quadratic
O(n^2)

## Big-O notation
Povides a useful approximation to the actual number of steps in the computation.

## exponential
O(2^n)

## logarithmic
O(log n)

## time complexity
Time complexity quantifies the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of input.

## brute force
A brute force technique for solving a problem typically tries to exhause all possibilities. 

## linear
O(n)

## order of magnitude
describes the part of T(n) that increases the fastest as the value of n increases.

## worst case
The worst case performance refers to a particular data set where the algorithm performs especially poorly. Whereas a different data set for the exact same algorithm might have extraordinarily good performance.
